            </div>

            <div class="letter">
                <p>Dear Reader,</p>

                <p>What did Winston Churchill mean when he said this? What about the outside of the horse is so
                    good for us humans? We all feel it: Horses are special. There’s something magical about being
                    able to jump on a horse’s back, fly over the fields, up and down hills, jumping any obstacles in
                    your path. There’s something just as transfixing, sharing a quiet moment before your ride to
                    show some gratitude for the partnership in which you’ve engaged. Are you looking for a horsey
                    fix? This may be just for you. Feeling curious about what engagement with another sentient being
                    feels like? Can you take a moment to slow down and listen to nature? If so, you will love this
                    experience. Already have experience? Awesome! We LOVE to pick the pace up whenever it doesn’t
                    come at the expense of the animal’s physical comfort.</p>

                <p>At Maverick’s, we pride ourselves in sharing with the public an experience that gives back to
                    the animals who have helped us become who we are. That’s not just us becoming Maverick Horseback
                    Riding, that’s Mankind advancing to where he has. Think on it: How have horses aided man in his
                    quests to feed himself, protect himself, advance his goals of global expansion? Would you, Dear
                    Reader, be where you are today if it were not for the back-breaking work of the Horse?</p>

                <p>Guests who seek out Maverick’s horsemanship experience love that we offer low-key, relaxing
                    trail rides AND engaging, challenging and highly rewarding horsemanship experiences. What’s best
                    is that groups with riders with mixed goals can come and ride AT THE SAME TIME and IN THE SAME
                    AREAS! Trail riders love the scenery, the beautiful and notoriously cared-for horses and the
                    fresh, open air. Horsemanship Adventurers appreciate how we take a moment to learn about
                    horsemanship and the land management that is necessary to maintaining a healthy herd. We also
                    address things like horse and rider personality pairing, how breathing and resulting tension or
                    lack thereof affect the rider’s arms, hands and resulting communication that the horse perceives
                    through his face (in a bites bridle), or through his teeth (if he has a metal bar or “bit” in
                    his mouth). We teach.</p>

                <p>We introduce our horses, our fellow co-workers to you. We invite you to feel the excitement of
                    riding a horse who appreciates his working conditions. We open our doors to folks who understand
                    that horses who feel appreciated, listened to and respected are the most enjoyable ones to ride.
                    We advocate giving riders the freedom to ride and control responsive horses because that’s what
                    horseback riding –and horsemanship– is all about. Want to learn more about our mission to share
                    animal and land stewardship with Texas and beyond? Read about us and find out about how your
                    ride with us funds our big plans to reach foster children, disadvantaged mothers and
                    socio-economically challenged families.</p>
