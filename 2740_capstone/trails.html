                    <p>In order to keep group sizes small and keep balance between providing a healthy environment and sustainability to
                        the animals and land, we are offering two options for trails. Current bookings are for Lockhart. Please TEXT 512-230-8413 or call for ride options in Austin, Blanco, Bastrop,
                        Canyon Lake, Granger Lake, Spicewood, Pairie Haynes, Matagorda Beach, Houston, TX and customized experiences!

                    <h3>The Ranch Ride</h3>
                    <h4>$115 per person</h4>

                    <p>is limited to 5-6 public riders. The session is about 2 hours from start to finish with about 1
                        hour and fifteen minutes mounted (on the horse.) It’s lightly instructional and the most leisurely of the rides.
                        There are elevation changes and some light trotting, so participants should be prepared for a bit of a workout.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>The BBQ Ride</h3>
                    <h4>Starting at $295 per person</h4>

                    <p>This is THE quintessential Texas experience. For small group excursions, you get to see the
                        whole Maverick Dude Ranch and more! Plan on spending the day with us for a journey you’ll never forget. Enjoy
                        our incredible bluff top views, woods, open pastures, water features and of course a Texas trail which leads you
                        right to the heart of downtown Lockhart, where you’ll be able to feast on world-wide adored Texas BBQ. Because
                        the mounted time (a little over 2 hours) is broken up into two or more separate sessions, this is a manageable
                        ride for children. A lunch or dinnertime break for BBQ plus a little shopping on Lockhart’s quaint square will
                        provide you and your team the chance to stretch your legs a bit.</p>
                
                    <h3>The Horsemanship Trail</h3>
                    <h4>$150 per person</h4>

                    <p>THE SHORT: This experience is a step up in complexity from the Ranch Ride. It’s more instructional, more
                        challenging, and more pick up the pace! Ideal for riders interested in our Year of Riding program OR
                        participants who really want to experience a horse boot camp trial, this trail is more instructional and can be
                        booked AT THE SAME SESSION as the Ranch Ride, so mixed groups can customize their experience. Horsemanship trail
                        arrives 45 minutes prior to Ranch Ride.</p>
                    <p>THE LONG: If you’ve had a chance to read about us, you know about our historically unique approach to trails,
                        which is starting to become more popular in the region! A lesson-based experience enables you to get comfortable
                        with animals and handlers on the ground first. Because our horses are responsive, they feel different: Here at
                        Maverick Guest Ranch, they like to go! On the ride, we’ll provide instruction on how to improve your
                        biomechanics to get a better response from the animal. It’s no ho-hum trail ride! This ride is appropriate for
                        some children, but not others. Please inquire if you have any questions. You can also schedule the Children’s
                        Introduction to Horsemanship on the Trail if you are interested in regular riding lessons, developing healthy
                        outdoor activity habits with your child at an early age, or exploring a fun, one-time activity with many
                        memorable photo opportunities!</p>
                    <p>If you are a mixed group you can either drop your Horsemanship Trail participants off at the ranch and then go
                        peruse the shops in downtown Lockhart (less than one miles from our ranch) or hit up the coffee drive through at
                        The Daily Grind and make offerings of Maverick Matcha Lattes, which is always sure to put a smile on everyone’s
                        face. Just sayin’.</p>
                    <p>Please be advised that Horsemanship Trail times may run a tad longer than the Ranch Ride, so plan accordingly.
                        Total ride time is an hour and a half to an hour and forty five minutes in the saddle. Total session time is
                        2.5-3 hours.</p>
                
                    <h3>The River Ride</h3>
                    <h4>$225pp for GROUP <br> or $350 pp for private excursions</h4>
                    <p>The River Ride builds off the Horsemanship Trail. It’s longer, too! If you don’t want the heavy level of instruction, we can arrange a private ride for you with a
                        handler who will pony (pull your horse), and provide a very laid-back experience.</p>
                
                    <h3>Children’s Intro to Horsemanship</h3>
                    <h4>$60 per session.</h4>
                    <p>Great for one time riders looking to come out and learn about and support what we are doing here on the dude
                        ranch. This option is also good for parents who want to explore a holistic approach to teaching horsemanship and
                        land stewardship. Feel free to simply book a ride and find out more or call us with questions.  Packages available for a discounted rate.</p>
                
                    <h3>The Private Ride</h3>
                    <p>The Private Ride is for individuals or small groups who wish not to ride with other public guests. The cost
                        varies depending on group size. One person is $250. Two people is $225 per person. Three people is $200 per
                        person and four or more is $185 per person. Enjoy a truly individualized experience where you’ll have the
                        opportunity to push yourself if you want!</p>

                            <p>We hope to reinstate these options soon to provide larger group rides that are more structured, more leisurely, and more typical of the modern day trail ride where you don’t have to do too much steering, just sit back and cruise. Till then, we are focusing our efforts on what made Maverick Ranch a Texas-wide hotspot: The Original Lesson on the Trail!</p>

You can book this ride alongside the Ranch and Bluff Top Trails for mixed groups. Best for individuals who want a physical and mental workout and want to know what “riding a real horse is really like.” This is what all of our original trails were based off of! We introduced the Ranch Ride and Bluff Top trail to give more nervous riders an option that doesn’t include as much instruction. In orer to pick up the pace you must be willing and able to accept instruction on how to improve the cue sets for our horses. We love to get up and go. We hope you do, too. Regardless of your skill set, we will work with you to see what we can accomplish. Thank you for understanding that our first responsibility is safety. Our second is the health of our horses. After that we bet you will have fun! Our Year of Riding is based off of this ride, and the River Ride.</p>
